The issues are read from a Jira Agile Board or individual issues can be provided to create single cards.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nJiraCards makes it super easy to generate physical cards from digital Jira issues. By default it fetches Jira issues from a given Jira Agile Board and generates for every found issue on the board a physical card. The generated cards are written to a HTML file. This HTML file can be used to print the cards.\r\n\r\nThe cards produced are clear and readable and a custom template can be provided to easily create custom looking cards.\r\n\r\nJiraCards uses the Jira REST API to get all the relevant data from Jira. You can provide a username and password for authentication. BasicAuth is used for authentication.\r\n\r\nOn an A4 page 6 cards are rendered. The cards can then be easily guillotined out and used on your physical board.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Using pip\r\n\r\nTo install JiraCards:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo pip install jira-cards\r\n\r\n### From source\r\n\r\nFirst, get the latest source code:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/hypebeast/JiraCards.git\r\n\r\nInstall it:\r\n\r\n    $ cd JiraCards\r\n    $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\n### Setup a development environment\r\n\r\nFirst, get the latest source code:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/hypebeast/JiraCards.git\r\n\r\nInstall dependencies:\r\n\r\n    $ cd JiraCards\r\n    $ make env\r\n\r\nRun JiraCards:\r\n\r\n    $ python bin/jira-cards -h\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nJiraCards reads the configuration from the following place:\r\n\r\n    $ ~/.jira-cards/config\r\n\r\nThe configuration file is created during the first startup of JiraCards.

If no template is provided, the default template is used.\r\n  * **default_issue_color**: The default color for a issue.\r\n  * **issueTypes**: The available issue types.
